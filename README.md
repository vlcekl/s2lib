# s2lib - general package for optimization of statistical mechanical models

s2lib is a Python package for optimization of general statistical
mechanical models based on arbitrary experimental and quantum chemical data.

The code is built on top of the scientific Python libraries (numpy, scipy,
matplotlib) and designed to be easily integrated with scikit-learn and
tensorflow machine learning packages. 

The purpose is to provide a unified set of tools for easy and fast
optimization of diverse types of statistical mechanical models,
from classical atomistic and coarse-grained force fields, to semiempirical models,
lattice systems, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.
